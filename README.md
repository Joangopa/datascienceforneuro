* MMSE : Mini Mental State Examination.*  The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) is a tool that can be used to systematically and
 thoroughly assess mental status.  It is an 11-question measure that tests five areas of cognitive function:
 orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall, and language.  The maximum score is 30.  A score
 of 23 or lower is indicative of cognitive impairment.  The MMSE takes only 5-10 minutes to administer and
 is therefore practical to use repeatedly and routinely
